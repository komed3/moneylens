# MoneyLens

**MoneyLens** is a web-based tool that transforms abstract money values into tangible, relatable comparisons.  
Enter any amount (in USD) and explore how it translates into:

- the physical weight or volume of precious metals
- stacks of coins and bills
- global income percentiles
- real-world goods and services
- and much more

The goal is to make money more understandable, visual, and meaningful — whether you're comparing small savings or massive fortunes.

This project is open-source and designed for easy international expansion.  
Built with simplicity and modularity in mind. Hosted via GitHub Pages.

Stay curious — and see your money through a new lens.
